# Klipper

Klipper is arguably the best clipboard management tool on Linux. Unfortunately klipper can only installed as part of plasma-workspace. which will pull in a large part of KDE. What I did here is split klipper out of plasma-workspace.

There're still some dependency on kde-frameworks, but this is way better than before.

## Dependency

* kdelib4support
* prison (for QR code support)
